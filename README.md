# Pouring at üçª

An app for finding which beers are currently pouring at different bars around the UK

## Motivation

The idea came from a trip to Bristol where I had a day to myself but couldn't easily find the best bars/breweries to visit or who would have the best drinks (I'm now an untappd user which would have been a start) but since then going for drinks in the Toon (Newcastle) can sometimes be made difficult since there are so many good places to go it is often decided by who is pouring the best drinks which again takes more effort than should be required hence the creation of this app
